# Alphabet-Soup
 
Alphabet [soup] is a real-time type displacement algorithm.

Taking any typed input, it slices the text string into individual glyphs and displaces them via font size according to the underlying light or dark pixels with little to no rendering time.

Using kerning, line height, font size, opacity, and colour, the user can control how legible or abstract they wish the composition to be.
